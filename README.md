# Agricultural-CO2-Emissions
The agricultural CO2 emission dataset has been meticulously compiled by merging and reprocessing numerous individual datasets sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Through a series of thorough data cleaning, preprocessing, and integration steps, these disparate datasets have been unified into a comprehensive and cohesive dataset, designed to facilitate in-depth analysis and accurate forecasting.

The dataset presented in the notebook specifically focuses on CO2 emissions attributed to the agri-food sector, which accounts for approximately 62% of the total global annual emissions. Undoubtedly, emissions from the agri-food industry play a substantial role in the context of climate change. The dataset highlights the significant contribution of these emissions to the overall global annual emissions.

Recognizing the environmental impact of the agri-food sector, it becomes imperative to address and comprehend its role in climate change. Developing sustainable practices within this industry is crucial to mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, a thorough analysis has been performed in the notebook. This analysis explores the intricate relationship between emissions, climate change, and geographic regions.

Furthermore, the notebook provides a practical examples of ML, employing it to predict percentage variations in temperatures. By showcasing this predictive modeling, the notebook aims to demonstrate how data analysis techniques can be effectively employed to gain insights into climate-related phenomena and facilitate informed decision-making in environmental research.

Overall, this dataset and the accompanying notebook offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of agricultural CO2 emissions, climate change, and geographic factors. It underscores the significance of sustainable practices in the agri-food sector and encourages further research and action to combat climate change effectively.
